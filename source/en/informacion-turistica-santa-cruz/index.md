1. To the Chiquitania or "The Missions".

Former Jesuit missions in the eastern department of Santa Cruz. Attractions are the churches and the architecture of the villages. It is economical to travel by public transport. With tour operators it is expensive, but comfortable and without wasting time.

### BUSES AND TRAINS
  In Bolivia there is no means of transportation for the middle class. Bus trips are almost always uncomfortable but economical. In some routes with good roads there is already the service with luxury buses (from Santa Cruz to Argentina, Cochabamba, La Paz); in other sections (eg Sucre) the buses are generally old and uncomfortable.

- To the Bimodal Terminal (buses / trains) (26) you can get to the micro 74 (from the hostel on the right), Bs 2,
