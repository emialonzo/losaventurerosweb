## Chain The Adventurers
The first Hostel Los Aventureros opened its doors in 2011, as a family business for exmochileros, designed to give the national and international traveler maximum comfort, for a reasonable price.

The most important thing in hostels Los Aventureros is the personal treatment that is given to the guest. We will gladly assist you in the planning of your trip to Bolivia, we will get you air tickets, we will advise you where to go to eat and we will put you in touch with the tour operators you need.

Our Hostels are not anonymous hotels but places to make friends and have fun. The rooms and the common areas are decorated in a cozy and artful way.

We offer all the necessary services:
  - WiFi in the rooms
  - laundry service,
  - breakfast,
  - 24 hours reception.

Upon arrival you will be given in written form complete information with a map about Santa Cruz and Samaipata.
